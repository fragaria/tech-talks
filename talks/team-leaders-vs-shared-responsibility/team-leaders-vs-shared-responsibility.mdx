# What are we dealing with?

Stuff starts to break apart when team leaders step out or get replaced.

<BaseLayout title="Symptoms of a collapsing team">

<Steps>

- Processes gradually **erode**.
- Meetings become **boring and unproductive**.
- Most folks have **nothing to say** on the retrospective.
- Soon, meetings **get often skipped** altogether.
- Team culture and general willingness to help others slowly diminishes. People **tend to play solo**.
- Team efficiency decreases and **delivery slows down**.

</Steps>

<BaseLayout title="Aren't the teams supposed to be self-organising?!">

<Steps>

<div>

## Self-organising != participating equally

In Scrum, the teams are said to be *self-organising*. However, that doesn't mean that all people in the team participate equally.

</div>

<div>

## The tendency to dominate is natural

If left alone, strong characters and more experienced team members tend to dominate and attract and *accumulate responsibility* rather easily.

</div>

<div>

## Hard to fix quickly

When the leaders leave the team, others can't fill up the gap right away as they're not used to play that role. Without guidance, they might be unable to prevent the team from collapsing.

</div>

</Steps>

<BaseLayout title="If the process is natural, how to avoid it?">

<Steps>

<div>

## Prevention

Preventing those team members from becoming the center of the universe always works best.

</div>

<div>

## Intervention

Scrum Master should intervene whenever he notices this happening.

</div>


<div>

## Awarness

Awarness is the key. Explain the issue to your team members and frequently remind them why we need to distribute the responsibility equally. We keep the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) bigger than 1 for code-related stuff. Why not doing the same on the HR level, too?

</div>

<div>

## Talk to your team leads

They might be the hardest nut to crack and argue that others aren't capable enough. Emphasize there's no progress without practice.

</div>

</Steps>

<BaseLayout title="Too late, we're there already. What now?">

<Steps>

<div>

## Talk it over

You should *discuss the issue* on the retrospective. Identify what key responsibilities and activities your leaders do which others don't.

Explore your options how the trend can be reversed. Agree to review the status on each following retrospective until you feel you're okay.

</div>

<div>

## Agree to take turns

Once you've identified the responsibilities, the best way to ensure everyone's able to cover them is to start taking turns on sprint basis.

E.g. agree that the team member selection to help the PO with the User Story preparation will work in a round robin mode.

</div>

<div>

## Start soon enough

If you plan to reassign your team leaders, make sure you're confident the team is ready. If you're not, start working on it right away.

</div>

</Steps>

That's it!

Thanks for your time.
